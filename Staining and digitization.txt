Staining:The CellPose deep learning pipeline segments pyramidal neurons from Nissl stained histological sections and includes automated exclusion of false-positive segmentations.The staining process was executed in the following manner: The tissue was first subjected to a defatting treatment with a mixture of chloroform and 100% ethanol (1:1). It was then pretreated with a mixture of acetic acid, acetone, 100% ethanol, and double distilled water (1:1:1:1). The tissue was stained in buffered thionin (8%) and differentiated in 70% ethanol with the addition of 5-10 drops of glacial acetic acid. It was then dehydrated through a series of ethanol concentrations (70%, 95%, 100%) and cleared in xylene. Digitization:Sampled sections were digitized at high resolution using a Keyence digital microscope (Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, USA). Parameters were vetted for 100x magnification.
